      <h2><strong>Operating Systems: CPU Scheduling & Race Condition Demonstration</strong></h2>
     <section>

  <p>
    This project focused on simulating key concepts in operating system design: 
    <strong>CPU scheduling</strong> and <strong>race conditions in multithreaded environments</strong>.
    <br><br>
    In the first part, I implemented two classic scheduling algorithms: 
    <em>First Come, First Serve (FCFS)</em> and <em>Shortest Job First (SJF)</em>. 
    The program calculated waiting times and turnaround times for a set of processes, 
    allowing comparison of how each algorithm impacts efficiency and process scheduling.
    <br><br>
    The second part demonstrated a <em>race condition</em> by using two threads that 
    concurrently modified a shared counter variable. One thread incremented the counter, 
    while the other decremented it. Because the operations occurred without synchronization, 
    the final value of the counter varied between executions, highlighting the risks of 
    concurrent programming without proper coordination mechanisms.
    <br><br>
    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with 
    <strong>CPU scheduling strategies, process management, concurrency, 
    and the importance of synchronization in multithreaded systems</strong>.

      <h2>Skills Learned</h2>
    
<p>
Through this project, I gained practical experience in applying operating system concepts to real-world programming. 
By implementing First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling, I learned how to analyze 
turnaround and waiting times and connect theoretical scheduling principles to measurable results. The race condition 
exercise strengthened my understanding of multithreading by requiring me to coordinate threads around a shared 
variable, demonstrating the importance of synchronization. Working through debugging and testing also developed 
my problem-solving and critical thinking skills, while documenting the project improved my ability to present 
technical work clearly and effectively.
